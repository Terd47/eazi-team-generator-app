This is a command Line application which makes adding new team members in your organization simple and easy. It will generate an html page with new team members provided by the user. The application prompts the user for information about the team such as role, name, email, id, e.t.c. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
